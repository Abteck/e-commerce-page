## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

Working on this project made me understand the concept of image slider/ carousal. I figured a way to manipulate it to work perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Continued development

moving forward, I'd love to expand my knowledege on image slider and know how everything works
